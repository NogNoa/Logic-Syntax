Objects:
O		# A simple Object.
O:P 	# An object that is O, and for which P is claimed.

Sets:
S		# A simple Set
{O}		# The set of objects that are O
\A\ O	# The set of all objects that are O.

	
Propositions:
O;P 	# A proposition that for object that is O, P is true.
OÎµS		# An object that is O is in S.
\E\ O	# An object that is O exists.
P /=> P # A proposition that if P than P.
P <=> P # A proposition that P if and only if P.



Moods:
LET {O} 	   # Introducing O. Existance is imperativly implied.
LET {P} 	   # Imperativly claiming P. 
DEF {O|P}	   # Introducing O as the object for which P is True. Existance is imperativly implied.
{P} 		   # Claiming P, relying on what was already Known.
ASM {P} name   # Introducing P as assumption without claiming it. P get a name.
SUP {P}		   # Claiming P, relying on all preceding assumptions. If a preceding assumption is found False, P is automaticly discarded.
SUP {P} name   # Claiming P, relying on an assumption. If the assumption is found False, P is automaticly discarded.
CNT {P}		   # Concluding that P is a contradiction. expects next line to claim an assumption False.
FLS name	   # an assumption is False.
PRV {P}		   # expect everything until QED to be what P is relying on, i.e the proof for P.
QED			   # End of proof. P is claimed and everything inside the proof is discarded.
NTT {P}		   # Imperativly introducing another way to refer to object already introduced.
